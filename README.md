## 🛠️ Project Setup (Windows/VS Code Optimized)  

### 1️⃣ API Key Configuration (Crucial!)  
You must obtain a Gemini API Key from **Google AI Studio** and set it as an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`.  

💻 **Setting the Environment Variable:**  
Run the command corresponding to your operating system **before** running the Python script.  

| Operating System | Command |
|------------------|---------|
| 🪟 Windows PowerShell / VS Code | ```powershell $env:GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_KEY_HERE' ``` |
| 🍎 macOS / 🐧 Linux (Bash/Zsh) | ```bash export GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_KEY_HERE' ``` |

> 🔑 Replace `YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key. The quotes are important!

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
- Install all required packages for AI communication and file handling:  
   - pip install requests PyMuPDF python-docx openpyxl python-pptx Pillow

### 3️⃣ Run the Assistant
